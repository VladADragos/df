    'Teachers are striking nationwide due to the news of Minerva Technologies’ recent launch of robotic teachers. They demand a ban these robot teachers saying it will cause massive job loss and lowered wages.',
    'Danielle Miller the president of the united states teachers union is leading the charge against robotic teachers.',
    '"If we do nothing about this it will lead to the extinction of the teacher profession. We have seen the consequences of automation in other industries, we do not want that to happen to us."',
    'Many have also spoken against robotic teachers because of privacy aspects',
    '“Who knows what they will do with the information they gather from millions of people. We have already seen that companies are willing to do whatever they can to increase their bottom line.”',
    'Miller also has concerns regarding the loss of human touch',
    '“It takes a human to teach a human. Robots do not have that human touch that is required for teaching people, especially for children. Do you really want a massive faceless corporation teaching your children?”',
    '“Teachers are role models for many of us, every one of us can look back and remember that one teacher that we really looked up to or who we thought was really kind and supported us during a perhaps very turbulent period. Learning is much more than just installing information into our brains. If teachers become robots it will lead to a great loss of human touch and a reduction of social interaction. “',
    '“What if a child feels a connection to their robot teacher, a teacher who is a machine and can not feel emotions, it is very deceptive and exploits the emotion of children for corporate profits.”',
    '“What if the is some accident and the robot malfunctions or hets hacked and hurts somebody, who will be responsible?” ',
