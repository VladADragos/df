    'After decades of development, Minerva technologies robot teachers are about to enter classrooms around the country. The company was started in 2020 after the sars COVID 2 pandemic as a spin-off from Alphabets e-learning division. ',
    '“We are very excited to finally be able to bring to deliver a product that we have been developing for a very long time“',
    'John Ericson CEO of Minerva Technologies',
    '“Education is paramount in today’s society, not for your success but for your survival. Education is what lifts people out of poverty. Lowering the cost of education will enable millions of people to get the education they deserve.”',
    'He continues',
    '“Many countries around the world have too few teachers. It takes time and money to teach somebody just so that they then will be able to teach others. Our product will allow for underdeveloped regions to catch up faster“',
    'Here are some of the features that Ericson mention in the companies annoucment live stream',
    '“M-1 is part of a bigger learning ecosystem, including a large database of already prepared and certified courses ready for schools to choose from”',
    'M-1 uses the latest teaching methodologies found from pedagogical research. This has allowed according to our internal studies for faster learning and higher knowledge retention',
    'Another of m-1:s key features is its ability to recognize and adapt to student facial expressions, allowing it to adapt the lecture',
    '“M-1 has the ability to answer complex questions thanks to its advanced gpt-15 language model and its DQL cortex.  It won’t be able to answer what the meaning of life and the universe itself is, but it will come close”',
    'Ericson also announced that the company would launch m-1 worldwide next year along with its IPO.',

    'Teachers are striking nationwide due to the news of Minerva Technologies’ recent launch of robotic teachers. They demand a ban these robot teachers saying it will cause massive job loss and lowered wages.',
    'Danielle Miller the president of the united states teachers union is leading the charge against robotic teachers.',
    '"If we do nothing about this it will lead to the extinction of the teacher profession. We have seen the consequences of automation in other industries, we do not want that to happen to us."',
    'Many have also spoken against robotic teachers because of privacy aspects',
    '“Who knows what they will do with the information they gather from millions of people. We have already seen that companies are willing to do whatever they can to increase their bottom line.”',
    'Miller also has concerns regarding the loss of human touch',
    '“It takes a human to teach a human. Robots do not have that human touch that is required for teaching people, especially for children. Do you really want a massive faceless corporation teaching your children?”',
    '“Teachers are role models for many of us, every one of us can look back and remember that one teacher that we really looked up to or who we thought was really kind and supported us during a perhaps very turbulent period. Learning is much more than just installing information into our brains. If teachers become robots it will lead to a great loss of human touch and a reduction of social interaction. “',
    '“What if a child feels a connection to their robot teacher, a teacher who is a machine and can not feel emotions, it is very deceptive and exploits the emotion of children for corporate profits.”',

    '"Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best"',
